/**
 * The FileManagementController class is responsible for handling file-related tasks in the application.
 * It uses various services to perform operations related to artists, songs, playlists, and customers.
 *
 * This class provides methods for:
 * - Importing data from CSV files
 * - Exporting data to CSV files
 * - Saving data to binary files
 * - Loading data from binary files
 *
 * The class has five attributes: fileManagementService, artistService, songService, customerService, and playListService.
 * These are instances of the respective services used by this controller.
 *
 * The class provides a constructor that takes instances of FileManagementService, ArtistService, SongService, CustomerService,
 * and PlayListService as parameters.
