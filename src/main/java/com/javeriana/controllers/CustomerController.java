/**
 * The CustomerController class is responsible for handling customer-related tasks in the application.
 * It uses various services to perform operations related to artists, playlists, and songs.
 *
 * This class provides methods for:
 * - Logging in a customer
 * - Adding a new playlist for the logged-in customer
 * - Retrieving the playlists of the logged-in customer
 * - Retrieving all songs
 * - Adding a song to a playlist
 * - Retrieving all songs from a playlist
 * - Deleting a song from a playlist
 * - Retrieving all artists
 * - Following an artist
 * - Retrieving the artists followed by the currently logged in customer
 * - Logging out the currently logged in customer
 *
 * The class has four attributes: customerService, artistService, playListService, and songService. These are instances of the respective services used by this controller.
 *
 * The class provides a constructor that takes instances of CustomerService, ArtistService, PlayListService, and SongService as parameters.
