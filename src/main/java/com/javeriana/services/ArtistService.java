/**
 * The ArtistService class is part of a music application and is responsible for managing artists.
 * It provides a variety of methods for handling artist-related operations.
 *
 * This class provides methods for:
 * - Adding new artists
 * - Deleting artists
 * - Finding an artist by their ID or name
 * - Retrieving a list of all artists, a list of the names of all artists, or a list of artists by their IDs
 * - Replacing the current list of artists with a given list
 * - Creating a map where the keys are artist IDs and the values are Artist objects
 *
 * This class uses a list to store artists. It also uses several methods for validating artist names and IDs.
