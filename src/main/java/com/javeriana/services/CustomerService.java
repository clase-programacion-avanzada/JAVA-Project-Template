/**
 * The CustomerService class is part of a music application and is responsible for managing customers.
 * It provides a variety of methods for handling customer-related operations.
 *
 * This class provides methods for:
 * - Adding new customers
 * - Deleting customers
 * - Finding a customer by their username
 * - Managing customer login and logout
 * - Managing the playlists of the currently logged in customer
 * - Managing the artists followed by the currently logged in customer
 * - Retrieving a list of all customers, a list of the names of all customers, a list of playlist IDs of a customer with a given username, and a list of all artists followed by all customers
 * - Replacing the current list of customers with a given list
 * - Checking if a customer is currently logged in
 *
 * This class uses a list to store customers and a Customer object to keep track of the currently logged in customer.
 * It also uses several constants for validating usernames, passwords, and the minimum age for registration.
