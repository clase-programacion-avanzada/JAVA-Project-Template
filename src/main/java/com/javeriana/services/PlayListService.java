/**
 * The PlayListService class in the com.javeriana.services package is a service class that provides methods for managing playlists in a music application.
 *
 * The class does the following:
 * 1. Initializes a list of PlayList objects in the constructor.
 * 2. Provides methods for adding a new playlist (addPlayList), replacing the current list of playlists with a given list (loadPlayLists), and getting a playlist by its ID (getPlayListById).
 * 3. Provides methods for removing a song from a specific playlist (deleteSongFromPlayList) and from all playlists (deleteSongFromPlayLists).
 * 4. Provides methods for getting a list of all playlists (getPlayLists), getting a map of playlists by their IDs (getPlayListsById), getting a list of the names of all playlists (getPlayListsToString), and getting a list of all songs in all playlists (getAllSongsInPlayLists).
 * 5. Provides a method for removing playlists with given IDs from the list of playlists (deletePlayLists).
