/**
 * The ReportService class in the com.javeriana.services package is a service class that provides methods for generating reports in a music application.
 *
 * The class does the following:
 * 1. Provides a method getMostFollowedArtists for returning a map of artist names to the number of times they are followed. It initializes an empty map, iterates over the followed artists list, and adds each artist's name to the map with a count. If the artist's name is already in the map, it increments the count.
 * 2. Provides a method getCountOfSongsByArtist for returning a map of song IDs to the number of times they appear in the given list. It initializes an empty map, iterates over the songs by artist list, and adds each song's ID to the map with a count. If the song's ID is already in the map, it increments the count.
 * 3. Provides a method maxSong for returning the ID of the song that has the maximum count in the given map. It initializes maxSong as null and max as 0, iterates over the entries in the most added songs map, and checks if the value (the count of the song) is greater than max. If it is, it updates max to the current count and maxSong to the current song ID.
